        "ideal_answer": "During pregnancy, you need more iron to support your baby's growth. Good iron sources include lean red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron better, so eat citrus fruits, tomatoes, or bell peppers with iron-rich foods. Avoid tea and coffee with meals as they can reduce iron absorption. Always consult your doctor about iron supplements, as too much can be harmful.",

        "ideal_answer": "Yes, exercise is generally safe and beneficial during pregnancy if you have no complications. Safe activities include walking, swimming, prenatal yoga, and light strength training. Exercise helps reduce back pain, improves mood, and may make labor easier. Avoid contact sports, activities with fall risk, and lying flat on your back after the first trimester. Start slowly if you're new to exercise. Always check with your doctor before starting any exercise program during pregnancy.",
